ISR-15627,75451,Create corporate note notification,Improvement,"As per ISR-12734, Notes visibility is currently poor, with users having to manually click through to the Notes tab to determine if Notes exist per item.
This ticket is to include the addition of a Subscribe option against a Product, which would enable notification of changes of corporate note changes as visible to that user. 
*User story*
As an End User, I need to be informed of changes to subscribed ISR Products Corporate Notes so that I can consider the impact of the change on my work activities.
*Acceptance criteria*
Given the user has selected an ISR Product, when the user subscribes to be notified of changes to Corporate Notes, then the system notifies the user when a new Corporate Note is added, deleted or edited in accordance with the users notification preferences.
When the user enables or disables their Corporate Note notification preferences, then the system uses the new preferences to notify the user of changes to corporate notes:
•	an email notification is sent if email notifications are  enabled and not sent if disabled
•	an in app notification is sent if in app notifications are enabled and not sent if disabled
•	both a email and in app notification is sent if both email and in app notifications are enabled
•	no notification is sent if both email and in app notifications are disabled

The user will be able to unsubscribe from an ISR product, which will stop all corporate note notifications against that product.

The Corporate note notification will be generic - ""A corporate note has been added/updated/deleted on a subscribed product > Link to View""

The ""Notes updated"" notification setting will be renamed to ""Shared notes""

ISR-15611,75435,Buffer input should not loose value after applying drawn geo,Improvement,"Buffer changes should not be lost while in draw mode. Currently if a user is in draw mode and changes the buffer, the buffer will not be saved when the user ""applies"" the geo edits. We should either disable the buffer form value while the user is in edit mode OR ensure that the ""apply"" picks up any changes to the buffer form value.

As a user, I would like to modify a buffer while drawing a geo on the maps
