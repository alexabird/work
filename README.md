along the lines of: "This will make a copy of the non-product items that you do not own (areas, searches, layouts) and assign the above access level to the space. Products cannot be duplicated and will be added as-is."

The request details were discussed originally but purposely pulled out of that design due to all of the complexities with it.  If they have decided they want that specific capability then we should definitely have a design ticket for just that capability



The use case being around the "usual" scenario of people working in a team, where the owner(s) would already have access to the space.  Although there's other cases, the goal would be to come up with a simplistic approach that would genericize all cases.

Given that, there was a meeting on Sept 21 to further discuss what this could look like. The notes from that meeting can be found here: https://jira.nciteglobal.com.au/confluence/display/ISR/ISR-14008+discussion. 
Ultimately it was confirmed there is no simple solution to achieve this feature.
